## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Description

This project consists of three main features built using javascript.
### 1. Navigation Bar

Navigation menu is built dynamically, that means that if any chages happened in the sections of the HTML file it will automatically updated in the navigation Bar.

### 2. Section Active State

While scrolling through the page, it should appear which section is being viewed.

### 3. Scroll to Anchor

When clicking any link from navigation bar, the link should scroll smoothly to the targeted section.
